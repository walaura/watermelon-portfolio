  about:
    - I designed & built a Twitter bot that generates random fanta cans. It works by randomly choosing an emoji from <code title="Twitter's emoji library">twemoji</code>, then generating a color pallette from it, and finally putting together an image and tweets it. The whole thing is built as a webpage that gets screenshotted, meaning all you see is CSS & HTML <em>(Turns out CSS can do layer blending modes now!)</em>
    - All the branding elements are thoughtfully handcrafted, I even obtained the Coca-Cola fonts from their press release to do the <strong>Zero Sugar</strong> bit. Only to then find out Fanta uses a custom variation. This culminated in me tweaking the vectors for hours to get it looking close enough. As far as I'm aware, while the bot receives a lot of criticism for implying clouds are edible, nobody has pointed out the typography is slightly off.

  about:
    - In addition to Fake Fantas I've also built a number of smaller Twitter bots, most of them built around generating HTML & CSS. Some of these work better as code showcases than as functional robots.
    - Some are very basic, like <strong>@twistmeknickers</strong> which will try to britishize words, to an awful effect. Others like <strong>@textbotbook</strong> try to make textbooks.
    - <strong>@pancakesorwaffl</strong> <em>(which generates video game moral choices)</em>, has a terrible dictionary, but pushes HTML+CSS to the limit. It has about 10 different UIs recreated in it, with rainbow text or 3D effects.

  about:
    - Index is TNW's data platform. It aggregates information on <strong>startups, brands, and investors</strong>. From 2015 to 2017 I was a key part of the small team that started this project as a way for our journalists to track startups and grew it into a powerful data tool.
    - I was responsible for implementing the original art direction as well as for the design of all new features. This work was heavily intertwined with the development itself as the team was extremely agile and eager to test new products and solutions.

        - Despite the complex, Facebook-Like layout and different pages, every component in Index works across all breakpoints without a hitch. Very early on we championed building every feature from, or into, a library of extremely flexible, responsive, reusable components.

        - The design language is powerful yet playful. It scales from simple consumption-heavy views to complex multilayered forms.

        - While sporting a flashier look, even promotional pages are part of the component system, gaining access to shared buttons, forms, and layout tools.

  about:
    - I joined a couple months before TNW's big 2015 redesign started its implementation phase. In that time I designed and shipped a couple of microinteractions on the current site such as an improved global nav, account menu, and even a very short lived monthly members newsletter (which had a different gif every week).
    - "A huge part of the redesign was Canvas, TNW's native ad format. The brief for this was simple: The article slides sideways, revealing a beautiful ad underneath. This presented as much of a technical challenge as it was a design challenge, having to consider questions like :what happens on scroll? how to treat phone screens? How to require as few creatives as possible?"
    - In addition I also designed & built the microsite for the Tech5 program. Including a super nifty map
